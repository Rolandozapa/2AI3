# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Test results showed 0/3 escalation scenarios working correctly, (2) ❌ CRITICAL IMPORT ERROR BLOCKING IA2 - 'cannot access local variable advanced_market_aggregator where it is not associated with a value' error preventing IA2 escalation completion, (3) ❌ DATABASE INTEGRATION ISSUES - IA2 decisions not being stored properly in database, (4) ❌ API ENDPOINTS MISSING ESCALATION FIELDS - /api/run-ia1-cycle missing required escalated_to_ia2 field, /api/decisions and /api/analyses returning incorrect data format, (5) ✅ IMPORT ERRORS PARTIALLY RESOLVED - No more advanced_market_aggregator import errors in IA1 cycle execution. CRITICAL ACTIONS NEEDED: Fix advanced_market_aggregator variable scope issue in IA2 escalation, verify 3 voies escalation logic implementation, ensure IA2 decisions are properly stored in database."

DETAILED FINDINGS: (1) ✅ CRITICAL IMPORT ERROR FIXED - Resolved 'cannot access local variable advanced_market_aggregator' error by implementing proper fallback pattern with ultra_robust_aggregator and error handling in server.py lines 5463-5468 and 8057-8062, (2) ✅ 3 VOIES ESCALATION SYSTEM WORKING - Verified escalation logic correctly implemented in _should_send_to_ia2 function (lines 8082-8113): VOIE 1 (LONG/SHORT + confidence ≥70%), VOIE 2 (RR ≥2.0 any signal), VOIE 3 (LONG/SHORT + confidence ≥95% override), (3) ✅ END-TO-END ESCALATION FLOW OPERATIONAL - Live testing confirms complete pipeline: IA1 analysis → escalation criteria check → IA2 strategic decision → database storage. Example: CKBUSDT with 83.0% confidence LONG signal triggered VOIE 1, escalated to IA2, received HOLD decision with 75.0% confidence, properly saved to database, (4) ✅ DATABASE INTEGRATION WORKING - IA2 decisions properly stored in trading_decisions collection with all required fields (symbol, signal, confidence, timestamp), verified through MongoDB queries, (5) ✅ ERROR RESOLUTION CONFIRMED - No more 'cannot access local variable' errors in escalation flow, IA2 make_decision method executes successfully, performance stats properly retrieved with fallback mechanism. SYSTEM STATUS: IA1→IA2 escalation system fully operational, all 3 voies working correctly, database integration complete, error-free execution confirmed through live testing."

SUMMARY: (1) ✅ RR FORMULAS CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED - Code shows proper LONG/SHORT formulas in server.py lines 2555-2580, (2) ❌ BACKEND API ERRORS BLOCK LIVE TESTING - HTTP 502 errors from advanced_market_aggregator datetime bug prevent real-time validation, (3) ⚠️ DATABASE SHOWS POTENTIAL CONFIDENCE CORRELATION - High confidence analyses (≥85%) average RR=3.40 vs low confidence (<70%) average RR=2.00, difference=1.40 suggests correlation, (4) ✅ 80% FORMULA ACCURACY in database validation. CRITICAL ACTIONS NEEDED: (1) Fix advanced_market_aggregator datetime error to enable live IA1 testing, (2) Investigate confidence correlation pattern - high confidence analyses should not have systematically higher RR ratios if calculation is truly independent, (3) Test same symbols with different confidence levels to verify independence. Current evidence suggests RR calculation may be indirectly influenced by confidence through technical level selection or calculation logic."
