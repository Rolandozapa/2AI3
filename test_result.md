# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

KEY FINDINGS: (1) ✅ RR FORMULAS CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED - Code analysis confirms proper implementation in server.py lines 2555-2580: LONG: RR = (Take_Profit - Entry) / (Entry - Stop_Loss), SHORT: RR = (Entry - Take_Profit) / (Stop_Loss - Entry). Formula validation shows 100% accuracy in test scenarios, (2) ❌ BACKEND API ERRORS PREVENT LIVE TESTING - All IA1 analysis endpoints returning HTTP 502 errors due to advanced_market_aggregator datetime error: 'unsupported operand type(s) for -: float and datetime.datetime'. This prevents real-time RR independence testing, (3) ⚠️ DATABASE ANALYSIS SHOWS POTENTIAL CONFIDENCE CORRELATION - Analysis of 21 existing IA1 analyses reveals concerning pattern: HIGH CONFIDENCE (≥85%) RR average = 3.40, LOW CONFIDENCE (<70%) RR average = 2.00, difference = 1.40. This suggests RR may be influenced by confidence level, (4) ✅ FORMULA VALIDATION 80% ACCURATE - Database validation shows 16/20 analyses match expected RR formulas within 0.2 variance, indicating core calculation logic is sound, (5) ❌ TECHNICAL LEVELS CONSISTENCY MIXED - Some analyses show support/resistance alignment with SL/TP levels, others use fallback percentages. EVIDENCE: Code review shows RR calculation uses technical analysis (support/resistance levels) not confidence percentages, but database pattern suggests correlation exists. Backend error prevents live validation of independence. RECOMMENDATION: (1) Fix advanced_market_aggregator datetime error to enable live testing, (2) Investigate why high confidence analyses have higher RR ratios - may indicate confidence is indirectly influencing technical level selection or RR calculation, (3) Test multiple analyses of same symbol with different confidence levels to verify independence."

SUMMARY: (1) ✅ RR FORMULAS CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED - Code shows proper LONG/SHORT formulas in server.py lines 2555-2580, (2) ❌ BACKEND API ERRORS BLOCK LIVE TESTING - HTTP 502 errors from advanced_market_aggregator datetime bug prevent real-time validation, (3) ⚠️ DATABASE SHOWS POTENTIAL CONFIDENCE CORRELATION - High confidence analyses (≥85%) average RR=3.40 vs low confidence (<70%) average RR=2.00, difference=1.40 suggests correlation, (4) ✅ 80% FORMULA ACCURACY in database validation. CRITICAL ACTIONS NEEDED: (1) Fix advanced_market_aggregator datetime error to enable live IA1 testing, (2) Investigate confidence correlation pattern - high confidence analyses should not have systematically higher RR ratios if calculation is truly independent, (3) Test same symbols with different confidence levels to verify independence. Current evidence suggests RR calculation may be indirectly influenced by confidence through technical level selection or calculation logic."
