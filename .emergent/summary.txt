The AI engineer systematically enhanced a dual AI trading bot across several critical areas. Initially, a robust MongoDB-backed anti-duplicate system was implemented, requiring resolution of a conflicting API endpoint. The LLM context window issue was addressed through prompt chunking, and the scout system's 4-hour data discipline was restored by fixing an unintentional cache clearing mechanism. A major focus was debugging and optimizing technical indicators (RSI, Stochastic, MACD), which involved fixing data persistence, correcting data types, adjusting lookback periods, and refactoring the MACD module. Critically, a pervasive CPU saturation problem was diagnosed and largely mitigated by identifying and neutralizing problematic  calls originating from third-party libraries (CCXT, yfinance) and asynchronous operations. The final resolved issue was a critical bug preventing successful IA1 analyses from being saved to the database. While RSI and Stochastic now function, MACD still returns zero values, requiring further investigation.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs technical analysis, escalating opportunities with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence. The system needs a scout for top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, filtered by volume/price changes and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must analyze these, generate entry, stop-loss, take-profit levels for independent RR calculation, detect chart patterns, and produce detailed technical summaries, avoiding duplicate tokens. OHLCV data (10 days for scout, 28 for IA1) must be systematically fetched from multiple sources, and all technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF) calculated. IA2 regenerates its own levels and RR for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trend logic adjusts LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent additions include enhanced OHLCV data sources, institutional validation via Dune Analytics, a sophisticated market condition scoring system for IA1, and optimized RR thresholds. The system must also correctly handle and display opportunity timestamps and prevent re-processing tokens within 4 hours.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed several critical issues to get the application fully operational with real-time data and analyses.

The primary focus was resolving the persistent problem where no new IA1 opportunities were appearing on the frontend. This was traced back to two major root causes:
1.  **Scout-Opportunities Disconnection**: The  endpoint was still returning fallback symbols with fictitious prices (e.g., BTCUSDT at , volume 1M) because the  method was fetching real BingX data but not persistently saving it into .
    -   **Fix**: The  endpoint logic in  was modified to ensure that the fetched real BingX trending data is correctly saved to . The cache for the  endpoint was also cleared to force a refresh. This successfully made  return real trending symbols (e.g., FLOKIUSDT, PUMPUSDT).
2.  **Missing IA1 Analysis Save**: A critical bug was identified where successful IA1 analyses were not being saved to the MongoDB database. Only error-triggered analyses had save logic.
    -   **Fix**: Explicit database save logic () was added to the  method in  just before a successful analysis is returned.

As a result of these fixes, the system is now generating and successfully saving IA1 analyses to the database, using real BingX trending symbols. Recent analyses for  and  confirm this.

Additionally, significant progress was made on technical indicators:
-   **RSI and Stochastic** are now correctly calculated and show real, non-default values (e.g., RSI 49.8, Stochastic 29.17/39.50 for IOTAUSDT). This was achieved by:
    -   Increasing OHLCV lookback days from 10 to 35 in .
    -   Correcting a dictionary/tuple type mismatch in the Stochastic calculation in .
    -   Ensuring the  provides  objects.
-   **Pattern detection** was successfully reactivated and integrated, detecting multiple patterns (e.g., Bullish Trend Continuation, Low Volatility Consolidation for NFPUSDT).
-   The **MACD calculation**, despite being refactored into a new module () and various attempts to fix it (adjusting lookback, debugging data inputs), still consistently returns 0.000000 in analyses. This remains an open problem.

The system's CPU usage, which was a major issue earlier, has been significantly stabilized, now operating around 65-90% during operations, which is within an acceptable range for a functional system.

Investigate the persistent MACD calculation issue, which still returns 0.000000 values, requiring deeper debugging.
