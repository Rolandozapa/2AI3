The AI engineer's work in this trajectory focused on resolving critical issues and adding new features to the dual AI trading bot. Initially, the primary goal was to fix the MACD indicator consistently returning zero values in IA1 analyses and to integrate Fibonacci retracement calculations, along with careful handling of Yahoo Finance as an OHLCV fallback.

The MACD debugging involved identifying a problematic micro-price scaling logic in  and subsequently, a more subtle bug where  values from the  system were being converted to  by the  method in . Fixing this  type handling was the breakthrough for MACD.

Fibonacci retracement was successfully integrated through a new  module, incorporated into  for analysis, prompt construction, and data storage.

However, after these fixes, a new issue arose: chartist pattern detection began reporting No patterns detected, prompting the AI engineer to investigate its current implementation status.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs technical analysis, escalating opportunities with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence. The system scouts top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, filtered by volume/price and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must analyze these, generate entry, stop-loss, take-profit levels for independent RR calculation, detect chart patterns, and produce detailed technical summaries, avoiding duplicate tokens. OHLCV data (10 days for scout, 28 for IA1) must be systematically fetched from multiple sources, and all technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF) calculated. IA2 regenerates its own levels and RR for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trend logic adjusts LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent additions include enhanced OHLCV data sources, institutional validation via Dune Analytics, a sophisticated market condition scoring system for IA1, and optimized RR thresholds. The system must also correctly handle and display opportunity timestamps and prevent re-processing tokens within 4 hours. The current work in the trajectory focused on fixing MACD, integrating Fibonacci retracements, and ensuring robust Yahoo Finance integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed the persistent issue of MACD values appearing as 0.000000 in IA1 analyses. This was pinpointed to  values from the  not being correctly handled by the  method in , causing them to be replaced with 0.0. This critical bug was fixed by modifying the  method to correctly cast  types to standard Python floats.

Concurrently, the Fibonacci retracement feature was fully implemented. This involved creating  to handle the calculations, integrating its output into the  method in , updating the IA1 prompt with Fibonacci analysis, and expanding the  data model in  to store these new fields. Backend testing confirmed that Fibonacci data is now correctly populated in analyses.

However, a new issue has emerged: after the MACD fix, the system started reporting No patterns detected for chartist pattern detection. The AI engineer is currently investigating this, having identified that the pattern detection system in  was temporarily disabled in the current codebase compared to a reference GitHub repository.
