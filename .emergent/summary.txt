The AI engineer focused on enhancing the Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot, addressing critical issues with MACD calculations, Fibonacci integration, and pattern detection. Initially, MACD values were zero due to  handling in 's  and erroneous initializations. Fibonacci retracement was successfully added with a dedicated  and integrated into the  and . Pattern detection was reactivated after finding it was disabled in  and .

Subsequent work revealed problems with IA1-to-IA2 escalation, caused by  not triggering IA2, IA1 using incorrect  instead of  for technical levels, and IA2 decisions not saving to the database. IA1's hardcoded price levels were replaced by AI-determined ones, and IA2 was adapted to calculate its own risk-reward. A complex adaptive RR logic for IA2 was implemented but later simplified per user request. Lastly, symbols not available on BingX Futures were filtered out, and the official BingX API became the source for tradable symbols. The current immediate task involves fixing IA2 decision persistence to the database.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading, leveraging IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for strategic execution. The system scouts the top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, filtering by volume, price, and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must perform detailed technical analysis, generating entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels for risk-reward (RR) calculation, alongside chart pattern detection and comprehensive technical summaries. It fetches 10 days of OHLCV data for scouting and 28 days for IA1 analysis from multiple sources, calculating various indicators including RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA (multi-TF), MFI, and VWAP (multi-TF). IA2 refines these levels and executes trades only if RR > 2.0 (initially, later adjusted with adaptive logic) and confidence > 80%. The system incorporates global market trend logic to adjust LONG/SHORT confidence, enhanced OHLCV data sources, institutional validation via Dune Analytics, and a sophisticated market condition scoring system. Crucially, the system must correctly handle and display opportunity timestamps and prevent re-processing tokens within 4 hours. Recent development focused on fixing MACD reporting zero values, integrating Fibonacci retracements, re-enabling chart pattern detection, ensuring correct IA1 price level calculations from LLM output, enabling IA2 to determine its own technical levels, and streamlining IA1-IA2 escalation logic.

<code_architecture>

-   : Core FastAPI application, orchestrating IA1/IA2 logic, database interaction, and API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed MACD assignment and handling in  (line 3920) and  construction (lines 3109, 3163, 3253) to correctly store  values. Re-enabled pattern detection (line 2015-2017). Integrated Fibonacci analysis. Modified  by moving it to the  class. Added IA2 escalation logic to  endpoint (line 5477). Corrected IA1 prompt to use  instead of  for entry price (line 2208). Updated  for simplified escalation logic (lines 9342-9368) and made it async. Modified IA2 prompt for simplified rules and dynamic market context. Corrected IA2 final level calculation to use AI-determined levels instead of hardcoded percentages (lines 5133-5147). Fixed  in IA2 prompt (line 4916). Crucially, implemented logic to save IA2  objects to the database (line 9218-9220). Updated IA1 price calculation logic to use  instead of  in level validation and RR calculation to prevent overwriting correct IA-provided levels (lines 2932-2935). Introduced  variables to preserve IA-provided levels for accurate RR calculation.
-   : Pydantic models for data consistency.
    -   **Changes**: Added , , , , , , ,  fields to  model.
-   : Detects chart patterns.
    -   **Changes**: Re-enabled Yahoo Finance OHLCV fetching (line 289-291) which was temporarily disabled.
-   : Optimized MACD calculation module.
    -   **Changes**: Removed micro-price scaling logic (line 52) and reduced  (line 91).
-   : New module for Fibonacci retracement calculations.
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate Fibonacci retracement logic.

    -   **Changes**: Confirmed to correctly calculate MACD values.
-   : Stores problem statements and testing data.
    -   **Changes**: Frequently updated with test results and progress throughout the trajectory.
-   : Updates trending crypto lists.
    -   **Changes**: Removed hardcoded entries (e.g., XTZUSDT) from static symbol lists (lines 181, 204).
-   : Fetches BingX symbols.
    -   **Changes**: Added  method for potential scraping of BingX market page (though this approach was abandoned). Modified  to use the official BingX API endpoint  for fetching tradable symbols.
-   : Used to fetch global market data.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes, but its functionality was integrated into the IA2 escalation logic.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of multiple OHLCV data sources for CoinMarketCap, TwelveData, and CoinAPI (while  is comprehensive, the user's initial pending task specifically mentioned resolving key/quota issues).
- Fully implement the actual data fetching logic within .
- Add the display of timestamps to the IA1 and IA2 thumbnails in the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on ensuring that IA2 decisions are correctly persisted to the MongoDB database and subsequently displayed in the frontend. It was identified that IA2 decisions, while successfully generated and logged, were not being saved into the  collection in the database. This critical gap meant that the frontend could not retrieve and display the latest strategic decisions made by IA2.

The specific problem was traced to the  file, where the  object, after being created by the  method, was simply returned or logged but not explicitly inserted into the database collection. The fix involved adding the following line of code after the IA2 decision is made:  within the orchestration logic (around lines 9218-9220 in ). A similar fix is also required for the  endpoint to ensure consistent behavior. This will ensure that all valid IA2 decisions are stored and available for the frontend.
