The AI engineer systematically enhanced a dual AI trading bot by addressing several critical functionalities. Initially, the focus was on expanding OHLCV data sources, successfully integrating BingX, Kraken, and Yahoo Finance, and later adding Bitfinex and CryptoCompare using provided API keys. Debugging efforts resolved various API-specific issues, leading to five robust data sources. Concurrently, the engineer identified and planned to address LLM context window limits. A significant enhancement was the integration of a sophisticated market condition scoring system into IA1, using multi-factor analysis to refine confidence scores. Following user feedback, the Risk-Reward (RR) calculation thresholds were optimized in IA1 to ensure more opportunities met the RR >= 2.0 criteria. The most recent work involved fixing a critical timestamp issue where all detected opportunities had identical times and implementing a robust anti-duplicate logic.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs technical analysis, escalating opportunities with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence. The system needs a scout for top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, filtered by volume/price changes and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must analyze these, generate entry, stop-loss, take-profit levels for independent RR calculation, detect chart patterns, and produce detailed technical summaries, avoiding duplicate tokens. OHLCV data (10 days for scout, 28 for IA1) must be systematically fetched from multiple sources, and all technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF) calculated. IA2 regenerates its own levels and RR for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trend logic adjusts LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent additions include enhanced OHLCV data sources, institutional validation via Dune Analytics, a sophisticated market condition scoring system for IA1, and optimized RR thresholds. The system must also correctly handle and display opportunity timestamps and prevent re-processing tokens within 4 hours.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of multiple OHLCV data sources in  for all mentioned APIs (CoinMarketCap, TwelveData, CoinAPI are still problematic due to key/quota issues).
- Fully implement the actual data fetching logic within .
- Resolve the LLM Context Window issue (145,648 tokens exceeding 128,000 limit) by implementing chunking for the LLM prompt.
- Integrate the anti-duplicate verification logic into the IA1 cycle to query the MongoDB database.
- Add the display of timestamps to the IA1 and IA2 thumbnails in the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical timestamp issue and implementing anti-duplicate logic. The problem was that all detected opportunities were being recorded with identical timestamps, making the 4-hour anti-duplicate mechanism ineffective.

The engineer identified that 's  field, while defaulting to , was being called rapidly in a loop, leading to identical timestamps for all opportunities. The fix involved modifying  (specifically at line 1372, based on the  edits) to ensure that each  created receives a unique, staggered timestamp, typically with a 15-second interval between opportunities.

Furthermore, the anti-duplicate logic, including the  function and preparation of a global cache (), was optimized and prepared for full integration into the IA1 cycle within . The last message confirms the timestamp staggering and initial anti-duplicate logic are in place, but full integration with MongoDB and frontend display of timestamps are still pending.
