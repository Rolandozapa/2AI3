The AI engineer's work focused on progressively enhancing a dual AI trading bot. Initial efforts tackled critical issues: resolving recurring datetime errors, rectifying technical indicator calculations from default values to actual computations, and refining the IA1 analysis flow. Key challenges included overcoming LLM response parsing failures and unintended fallback logic that led to square confidence scores instead of organic ones. The engineer also addressed the scout system's incorrect filtering, IA1's lack of opportunity rotation, and misconfigured IA1-to-IA2 escalation logic. Significant refactoring improved IA2's autonomy in regenerating its own trade levels and risk-reward ratios. Most recently, efforts centered on broadening OHLCV data sources, integrating institutional validation via Dune Analytics, and fixing persistent  and  object errors that hindered analysis persistence and sophistication. The overall progression shows a systematic approach to fixing, validating, and then enhancing core trading logic and data integrity.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs technical analysis, escalating opportunities with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence for execution. The system requires a scout to fetch top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, applying filters (min 5% daily volume change, min 1% price change) and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must correctly analyze these filtered opportunities, generate specific entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels to calculate Risk-Reward (RR) independently of AI confidence, detect chart patterns, and produce detailed technical summaries, avoiding duplicate tokens. Micro-prices should be manageable, and OHLCV data must be systematically fetched for all scouted cryptos (10 days for scout, 28 days for IA1). All technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Band, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF) must be calculated, and IA2 should regenerate its own levels and RR for trade execution, where RR > 2.0 is a trigger. The system should incorporate global market trend logic to adjust confidence for LONG/SHORT positions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the OHLCV data fetching system and integrating institutional validation. The  file was being refactored to support more robust multi-source data retrieval using various APIs (Yahoo Finance, Bitfinex, CoinAPI, Binance, Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, TwelveData, Cryptocompare), with API keys for these services already added to .

A new module, , was created and partially integrated into  to provide a layer of institutional validation for IA2 decisions, leveraging on-chain volume and liquidity data. The  method was added to  to incorporate Dune Analytics data, enriching the decision-making process.

The immediate next step in this ongoing task is to install the  library to enable data fetching from Yahoo Finance, one of the new OHLCV sources. This indicates that the  refactoring is progressing, and the system aims for more comprehensive market data inputs to support IA1 and IA2.
