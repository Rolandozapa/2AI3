<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work primarily involved a series of iterative enhancements and critical bug fixes for a Dual AI Trading Bot. Initial efforts focused on refining IA2's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation, transitioning from a complex volatility-based approach to a simpler support/resistance logic as requested by the user. This involved significant prompt engineering and debugging of f-string formatting errors ().

Following the RR fix, the work expanded to integrating advanced market intelligence. This included developing an intelligent OHLCV fetcher for high-frequency data (5-minute intervals) for IA2, and a global crypto market analyzer to provide general market conditions (price, volume, market cap, fear/greed) to both IA1 and IA2, complete with fallback mechanisms for API rate limits.

Crucially, the engineer implemented an override for IA1-to-IA2 escalation based on high sentiment (95%+) and a bonus/malus system for IA1 confidence, penalizing short positions during market cap increase and long positions during market cap decrease. The latest phase involved repository cleanup and optimization, followed by a user request to initiate refactoring focusing on performance issues, specifically identifying and resolving CPU-intensive loops. The AI engineer is currently in the diagnostic phase for performance.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application for automated, sophisticated trading on BingX Futures, leveraging GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading. A key architectural requirement is the dual AI pipeline: IA1 analyses with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 feed into IA2, which requires >80% confidence for execution.

The product aims for highly selective and precise trading signals using advanced indicators (VWAP, MFI, Multi EMA/SMA, multi-timeframe analysis) and robust risk management.

Key user requests and product enhancements within this trajectory include:
1.  **IA2 RR Calculation Simplification**: IA2's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation must use a simple support/resistance formula, consistent with IA1's logic, replacing complex volatility-based calculations.
2.  **Intelligent OHLCV for IA2**: Implement a module for IA2 to fetch finer-meshed OHLCV data (e.g., 5-minute intervals) from a different API source than IA1, to enable more precise S/R level calculations and dynamic RR.
3.  **Sentiment-Based IA2 Override**: Create an override mechanism where IA1 analyses with a sentiment (long/short) exceeding 95% confidence are automatically escalated to IA2, even if other RR/confidence criteria are not met.
4.  **Global Crypto Market Conditions**: Integrate a module to fetch general crypto market conditions (e.g., 24h volume, Bitcoin dominance, market cap, fear & greed index) from external APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Binance fallback) and feed this context to both IA1 and IA2. Ensure critical variables like 24h market cap change are robustly fetched.
5.  **Market Cap-based Confidence Adjustment**: Implement a bonus/malus logic in IA1's confidence calculation, penalizing short positions if the 24h market cap increases and long positions if it decreases, to align with global market momentum.
6.  **Repository Optimization**: Clean up the codebase by removing unnecessary files and identify areas for future refactoring, particularly focusing on performance.
