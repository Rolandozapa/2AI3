<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing a dual AI trading bot. Initially, critical performance issues were tackled by optimizing backend processes and frontend polling. A major bug involving a  error in the IA2 decision-making pipeline was addressed by simplifying IA2's prompt, which unfortunately led to a broken IA1â†’IA2 pipeline and missing API endpoints. The engineer systematically restored the pipeline, fixed orchestrator initialization, re-enabled essential frontend-facing API endpoints, and corrected JSON serialization issues.

Subsequent efforts refined IA2's strategic reasoning by updating its prompt, adding advanced technical indicators (MFI, VWAP, EMA hierarchy) to IA1's analysis and IA2's input, and enabling IA2 to determine its own trade levels and recalculate Risk-Reward. A critical parsing bug for Claude's markdown-wrapped JSON responses was also resolved. Most recently, the focus shifted to fixing stale market opportunities. The engineer diagnosed that the system was using a fixed fallback symbol list and that the trending auto-updater was failing. The final actions involve integrating BingX API data into the trending auto-updater and ensuring the market aggregator utilizes this fresh data instead of cached, old opportunities.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates sophisticated trading on BingX Futures using GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decision-making. IA1 analyses with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 escalate to IA2, which requires >80% confidence for execution.
Key enhancements include:
1.  **IA2 RR Calculation**: Align with IA1's support/resistance logic.
2.  **Intelligent OHLCV for IA2**: Fetch finer-meshed OHLCV data for precise S/R.
3.  **Sentiment-Based IA2 Override (VOIE 3)**: Escalate IA1 analyses with >95% sentiment to IA2.
4.  **Global Crypto Market Conditions**: Fetch market data (volume, BTC dominance, market cap) from external APIs for both AIs.
5.  **Market Cap-based Confidence Adjustment**: Bonus/malus logic in IA1 confidence.
6.  **Repository Optimization**: Performance refactoring and CPU optimization.
7.  **Internal Position ID**: Generate unique  to link IA1 analyses to IA2 decisions for traceability.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the persistent timestamp mismatch error for non-BTC/ETH symbols during BingX trade execution.
-   Evaluate and potentially adjust Risk Management parameters to allow trades with smaller balances.
-   Address the recurring issue of the trading system reverting to SIMULATION mode.
-   Fully resolve the  error that still prevents proper IA1 cycle completion and opportunity storage.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical issue where the opportunities displayed on the frontend were stale and not being refreshed, despite the backend BingX API integration working correctly. It was identified that  was using a fixed, hardcoded list of fallback symbols instead of dynamically fetching trending cryptocurrencies from the newly implemented BingX API in .

The previous engineer, with the help of a test agent, made the following corrections:
1.  Ensured the  (which finds opportunities) now correctly uses BingX data via .
2.  Modified the  to save the newly scanned opportunities to the database, ensuring persistence and availability for the frontend.
3.  Fixed a  related to  (changed to ).

The work concluded right after these fixes were applied, but before verification. The expectation is that with these changes, the system should now be able to generate and store fresh market opportunities based on real-time BingX data.
