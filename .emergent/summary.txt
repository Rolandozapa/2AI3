The previous AI engineerâ€™s work began by addressing critical performance issues, stemming from high CPU usage (initially 97-100%). This involved optimizing frontend polling, reducing backend  workers, and refining  loops. A major breakthrough was fixing the  call which caused multiprocessing spawns. Despite these, an  error occasionally disrupted IA1 cycles, but the primary focus shifted to functional issues.

The engineer then implemented a robust Position ID tracking system to link IA1 analyses to IA2 decisions, enhancing traceability and resilience. A significant challenge was a persistent  bug in IA2's prompt generation, leading to fallback decisions instead of detailed strategic reasoning. Multiple attempts to pinpoint this bug led to a temporary fallback mechanism ensuring system stability. Finally, the engineer tackled IA2's display issue (decisions not appearing) by ensuring fallback decisions were correctly stored and retrieved. The trajectory concludes with a decisive move to simplify IA2's complex prompt, deleting a large section of old, problematic code, aiming for a permanent fix for the IA2 reasoning.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application for automated, sophisticated trading on BingX Futures. It leverages GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading, with a dual AI pipeline: IA1 analyses with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 feed into IA2, which requires >80% confidence for execution. The product emphasizes selective, precise trading signals using advanced indicators and robust risk management.

Key enhancements implemented or addressed within this trajectory include:
1.  **IA2 RR Calculation Simplification**: IA2's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation must align with IA1's simple support/resistance logic. (Implicitly addressed by refactoring).
2.  **Intelligent OHLCV for IA2**: Module for IA2 to fetch finer-meshed OHLCV data (e.g., 5-minute) from different API sources for precise S/R. (Integrated and functional).
3.  **Sentiment-Based IA2 Override (VOIE 3)**: IA1 analyses with >95% sentiment are escalated to IA2, overriding other criteria. (Implemented, functional, but IA2 execution bug masked its output).
4.  **Global Crypto Market Conditions**: Module to fetch general market conditions (volume, Bitcoin dominance, market cap, fear/greed) from external APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Binance fallback) for both IA1 and IA2. (Implemented and functional).
5.  **Market Cap-based Confidence Adjustment**: Bonus/malus logic in IA1's confidence based on 24h market cap change. (Implemented).
6.  **Repository Optimization**: Clean up and identify areas for performance refactoring. (Initial cleanup done, CPU optimization completed, but ongoing refactoring for IA2 is in progress).
7.  **Internal Position ID**: Generate a unique  to link IA1 analyses to IA2 decisions, ensuring traceability and resilience after restarts. (Implemented and functional).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on definitively resolving the persistent  bug within the IA2 decision-making pipeline. Despite previous attempts to pinpoint and fix specific problematic f-strings and variable accesses, the bug continued to manifest, leading to IA2 generating fallback decisions instead of detailed strategic reasoning.

To address this, the AI engineer has adopted a radical approach: simplifying the entire IA2 prompt and its generation logic. The trajectory concludes with the engineer having just **deleted a large section of the old, complex IA2 prompt code (from lines 4200 to 9273 in )** and replaced it with a new, minimal prompt structure. This action is intended to eliminate the source of the  bug once and for all, allowing for a fresh, robust implementation of IA2's strategic reasoning. The immediate next step would be to test this newly simplified IA2 implementation to confirm that it now functions correctly without the previous errors and generates proper strategic decisions.
