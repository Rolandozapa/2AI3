The AI engineer's work focused on stabilizing and enhancing a dual AI trading bot. Key efforts included establishing a robust market data pipeline by integrating BingX API for trending opportunities, implementing filters for volume, price, and lateral patterns, and ensuring the 'scout' consistently provided fresh, filtered data to IA1. Significant challenges involved correcting data flow between , , and  to prevent stale data. The engineer addressed issues with IA1 analyses not saving to the database, not being visible on the frontend, and a recurring JavaScript error due to  being a string instead of an array. The latest phase refined IA1's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation, which involved generating realistic entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels with correct LONG/SHORT formulas. Although a confidence-based RR strategy was implemented, the user explicitly requested that RR calculation should not depend on confidence. The engineer's final action in the trajectory was to adjust this logic to de-couple confidence from RR, and there are still some inconsistencies in the latest analysis showing low RR values.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates trading on BingX Futures using GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decision-making. IA1 analyses with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 escalate to IA2, which requires >80% confidence for execution. The application aims to resolve stale market opportunities by using a functioning autonomous trend detection system () that fetches the top 50 market cap BingX futures every 4 hours. This scout should apply filters for a minimum daily volume change of 5%, a minimum price change of 1%, and automatically filter out lateral (sideways) patterns without true trends. IA1 must then correctly analyze the latest selection from this scout. IA1 also needs to generate specific entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels (with different equations for LONG/SHORT strategies) to calculate the Risk-Reward (RR) ratio. This RR calculation should be independent of the AI's confidence. The system also requires a robust OHLCV fallback API system for IA1's technical analysis and the internal generation of unique  for traceability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on IA1's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation. The goal was for IA1 to generate entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels for LONG/SHORT strategies, and then calculate RR using different equations based on the strategy type. This RR was intended to determine escalation to IA2 if it met the ≥ 2.0 threshold.

The engineer implemented logic in  to set these levels and calculate RR, initially making the SL/TP percentages dependent on IA1's confidence. This led to a test case (CKBUSDT) with 91.9% confidence successfully generating an RR of 2.67:1, which enabled IA2 escalation. However, testing also showed inconsistent or illogical values in some cases (e.g., negative take-profit, low RR for other symbols like PENGUUSDT).

The user's most recent feedback explicitly stated: La confiance ne doit pas faire varier ou dépendre du rr mais Sinon je suis ok du reste. This indicates that while the formulas and the general concept of IA1 generating levels for RR calculation are acceptable, the direct dependency of SL/TP (and thus RR) on IA1's confidence level is not desired. The engineer's last action in the trajectory was to make edits in  to address this specific user request, decoupling confidence from the RR calculation logic.

<optional_next_step>
Adjust the IA1 RR calculation logic in  to remove the dependence of stop-loss and take-profit levels on IA1's confidence, ensuring fixed or independently determined levels while maintaining correct LONG/SHORT RR formulas.
